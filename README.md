<h3>About</h3>
<p align="left">
Ninja Adventure is loosely inspired by <a href="https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/">Breath of the Wild</a>, where there are various boss fights and
RPG mechanics that can also be found in Ninja Adventure. The asset pack that is being used
in this project can be found below. If you'd feel so inclined, please consider contributing to 
this project through creating pull requests or issues; it would mean a lot.
</p>

<h3>Install</h3>
It is recommended to install the latest <a href=https://github.com/JoshuaDRose/Ninja-Adventure/tags>release</a> as
 the main branch is not always release-ready.<br>
<br>


```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```
> Dependencies can be install using pip
```sh
python3 src
```
> Runtime path is mutable and can be run from out or inside of `./src`
```sh
python3 __main__.py
```
> Example of running from inside `./src`

<h3>Contributing</h3>

If you are making changes to the code, installing development dependencies is also recommended.<br>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaDRose/Ninja-Adventure.git
git checkout main
```
> Installing the latest release is optional
```sh
python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements/base.txt
python3 -m pip install -r ./requirements/dev.txt
```
> Install all required requirements files
