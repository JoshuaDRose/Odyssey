<h3>About</h3>
<p align="left">
Odyssey is loosely inspired by <a href="https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/">Breath of the Wild</a>. The RPG elements such as boss fights, foreging, quest taking, exploration from Breath of the Wild that were or are currently) being put into Odyssey are very close to my heart, and I hope you enjoy the game as much as I enjoy creating it.
</p>
